TO-DO

Move clean up to separate thread
Add some logging that is worth a hoot.
Firefox SQLite parsing
	"Recent versions of Firefox use "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL" which requires
	SQLite version 3.7.0 or later.  You won't be able to read the database files
	with SQLite version 3.6.23.1 or earlier.  You'll get the "file is encrypted
	or is not a database" message." 
Change cleanup to be prior to analyzer
ReReview AnalyzeMFT or find a different offline mft.dat script.  AnalyzeMFT has errors on some mft.dat files - hexacorn's hmft.exe works nicely
Prefetch parser
Add option level 3 files to comparison
Add option to feed in user list of md5's for comparison - combination/addition - lucky punch
Spawn Pinging thread for notification if host went offline
Event Logs - still having an issue with some EVTX files with spaces in the name
Prefetch Files for Win7 - what are the db files
Recyclebin parser for Win7
Add How Many Days options for TLN - current is 30
Execute Volatility "vol.py --help", parse out plugins and determine plugins to use from that
add jumplists
Combine commands for less password prompts?
sticky notes
Make IDT Hooks stand out
Compare processes and md5 hash of each
Parse .log, .sav and DEFAULT - if need be
Add if >=Win7 run ProductPolicy RR plugin

Check DEP settings
	wmic OS Get DataExecutionPrevention_Available
	If the output is "TRUE," hardware-enforced DEP is available.
	To determine the current DEP support policy, follow these steps.
	wmic OS Get DataExecutionPrevention_SupportPolicy
	The value returned will be 0, 1, 2 or 3. This value corresponds to one of the DEP support policies that are described in the following table.
	DataExecutionPrevention_SupportPolicy property value	Policy Level	Description
	2	OptIn (default configuration)	Only Windows system components and services have DEP applied
	3	OptOut	DEP is enabled for all processes. Administrators can manually create a list of specific applications which do not have DEP applied
	1	AlwaysOn	DEP is enabled for all processes
	0	AlwaysOff	DEP is not enabled for any processes
	Note To verify that Windows is running with hardware DEP enabled, examine the DataExecutionPrevention_Drivers property of the Win32_OperatingSystem class. In some system configurations, hardware DEP may be disabled by using the /nopae or /execute switches in the Boot.ini file. To examine this property, type the following command at a command prompt:
	wmic OS Get DataExecutionPrevention_Drivers
